## ‚≠ê Overview

`algo-trading-bot` is an advanced open-source framework designed for developing, backtesting, and monitoring algorithmic trading strategies with an emphasis on data-driven decision-making and real-time insights.

> Traditional trading often involves manual research, emotional decision-making, and a lack of systematic backtesting, leading to inconsistent results and missed opportunities. Developing and testing complex strategies can be cumbersome, and real-time monitoring and reporting are frequently manual processes, making it challenging to react swiftly to market changes or track performance effectively.

This project addresses these challenges by providing a robust, automated pipeline for historical data acquisition, machine learning-driven signal generation, comprehensive backtesting, and automated reporting. It empowers traders and researchers to systematically design, validate, and monitor their strategies, reducing manual overhead and providing timely, data-backed insights directly to their preferred channels.

At its core, `algo-trading-bot` is a modular, pipeline-driven application. It features distinct layers for data acquisition and cleaning, core strategy logic (both rule-based and machine learning-driven), a dedicated backtesting engine for performance validation, and robust reporting and notification services for real-time awareness and detailed performance tracking. Configuration is centralized for ease of management, and the `main.py` script orchestrates the entire workflow.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Automated Data Ingestion:** Fetches and cleans historical stock data from `yfinance`, ensuring a reliable and clean dataset for analysis and backtesting.
*   **Machine Learning-Enhanced Signals:** Leverages `scikit-learn` for training, persisting, and deploying predictive models (`DecisionTreeClassifier` inferred) to generate intelligent and data-driven buy/sell signals.
*   **Comprehensive Backtesting Engine:** Simulates trading strategies on historical data with a fixed-holding approach, providing critical insights into potential performance, risk, and profitability before live deployment.
*   **Integrated Performance Reporting:** Generates detailed trade reports in CSV format and automatically logs key trade metrics to Google Sheets, enabling accessible, cloud-based performance tracking and analytics.
*   **Real-time Trade Alerts:** Sends instant, formatted trade notifications and alerts via Telegram, keeping users informed of significant market events or generated trading signals on the go.
*   **Modular Strategy Design:** Supports the application of both traditional technical indicators (via `ta` library) and advanced machine learning models for flexible and extensible strategy development.
